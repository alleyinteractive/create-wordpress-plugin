# Create WordPress Plugin

This is a skeleton WordPress plugin that can scaffold a WordPress plugin. This
template includes a base plugin file, autoloaded PHP files, unit tests powered
by [Mantle](https://mantle.alley.co/), front-end assets compiled via Webpack,
and Continuous Integration [via GitHub Actions](.github/workflows). Actions are
configured to test the plugin and also build it for release. A `main-built`
branch and `v0.1.0-built` tags will be created with all dependencies included
for use when submoduling a plugin. The built branches will include Composer
dependencies and any compiled front-end assets (if using them).

The plugin supports front-end assets which can be enqueued inside
`src/assets.php`. For plugins that don't require front-end assets, the
configuration script below will prompt you to delete the front-end files if you
don't wish to use them.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Press the "Use template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo
   with the contents of this skeleton.
2. Run `make` (or `php ./configure.php`) to run a script that will replace all
   placeholders throughout all the files.
3. Have fun creating your plugin! ðŸŽŠ

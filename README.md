# Create WordPress Plugin

This is a skeleton WordPress plugin that can scaffold a WordPress plugin. This
template includes a base plugin file, autoloaded PHP files, unit tests powered
by [Mantle](https://mantle.alley.co/), front-end assets compiled via Webpack,
and Continuous Integration [via GitHub Actions](.github/workflows). Actions are
configured to test the plugin and also build it for release. A `main-built`
branch and `v0.1.0-built` tags will be created with all dependencies included
for use when submoduling a plugin. The built branches will include Composer
dependencies and any compiled front-end assets (if using them).

The plugin supports front-end assets which can be enqueued inside
`inc/assets.php`. For plugins that don't require front-end assets, the
configuration script below will prompt you to delete the front-end files if you
don't wish to use them.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Press the "Use template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo
   with the contents of this skeleton.
2. Run `make` (or `php ./configure.php`) to run a script that will replace all
   placeholders throughout all the files.
3. Have fun creating your plugin! ðŸŽŠ

### Updating WP Dependencies

Updates the [WordPress dependency packages](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/#packages-update) used in the project to their latest version.

To update `@wordpress` dependencies to their latest version use the packages-update command:

```sh
npm run packages-update
```

This script provides the following custom options:

-   `--dist-tag` â€“ allows specifying a custom dist-tag when updating npm packages. Defaults to `latest`. This is especially useful when using [`@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin). It lets installing the npm dependencies at versions used by the given WordPress major version for local testing, etc. Example:

```sh
npm run packages-update --dist-tag=wp-WPVERSION`
```

Where `WPVERSION` is the version of WordPress you are targeting. The version
must include both the major and minor version (e.g., `6.1`). For example:

```sh
npm run packages-update --dist-tag=wp-6.1`
```

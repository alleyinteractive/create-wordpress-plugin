Example Slotfill styles.

@purpose
  Styles for the example-slotfills entry point.

  All style based entry points should be named 'index.scss' as
  naming the stylesheet 'style' may conflict with the build system.

  Avoid using style keyword in an entry point name, this might break your build process.

  You can also bundle CSS modules by prefixing .module to the extension, e.g. style.module.scss. Otherwise, these files are handled like all other style.scss. They will also be extracted into style-index.css.
